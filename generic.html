							<p style="font-family: Helvetica">Anyways, a little bit about myself, I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto specializing in Mathematics and its Applications in Statistics/Probability and finished a major in Actuarial Science. I started off my undergrad majoring in Actuarial Science with the goal of becoming an actuary, although I did really well in actuarial science courses and I could probably take the exams, being an actuary required other skills so I weighed the pros and cons and wanted to have more career choices in the future and potentially go into grad school to do something I am passionate about, so I majored in Statistics. There were overlaps between actuarial science courses and statistics so the addition of a statistics major was easy. The completed actuarial science major is still useful though, since I learned finanicial concepts like derivatives, markets, etc which would be helpful in future data analysis roles in financial companies. I also got a taste of applied statistics and worked with data in finance. Then during third year, I took this course called introduction to abstract mathematics and some other math course and got addicted to math. "addicted" as in something I could sit all day and think about and did really well in. So I chose the specialist in mathematics & its applications in statistics/probability program in the end which is an enhanced statistics and math double major. I like the rigour in math and enjoy the beauty of it, but I would prefer applying it to things as it opens up more career opportunities than to study math for the sake of it (pure maths). More about me......</p>
							<p style="font-family: Helvetica">I would consider myself a pretty flexible person who can adapt to change easily. I am also really physically active, I started playing soccer at a young age at a competitive level but now I just play it for fun (intramurals). I wouldn't mind learning a new sport.</p>
							<p style="font-family: Helvetica">I recently got into long distance running. It started when I was sitting too long listening to online lectures, so I decided to go out for a walk, but then a walk turned into a run, a run turned into a long run. After running a few times, I wanted to do a marathon and my friend also decided to go but we ended up doing a half marathon (thank god). Here is a link to my run stat for the TCS marathon 2022: <a href="https://www.sportstats.ca/display-results.xhtml?raceid=114381&bib=10238">run stat tcs</a>. I completed the half marathon in 2h 30min which is not bad I guess, since I was under prepared. My goal for 2023 is to run a full marathon in 4h. </p>.
